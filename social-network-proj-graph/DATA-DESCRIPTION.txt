This dataset represents a weighted undirected graph, where the nodes correspond to users in a social network 
and the edges represent interactions or connections between them. The weight on each edge indicates the 
frequency or strength of the interaction between the two connected users, with higher values representing 
more frequent or stronger connections.

The file format consists of a list of weighted edges, where each line corresponds to a single edge in the graph:
i j w

i and j are the identifiers of the two connected nodes, and w is the weight.
